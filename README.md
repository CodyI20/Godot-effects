# Godot-effects
This repo holds a game in Godot which I took as a base to add different kinds of effects and shaders to JUICE IT UP!

Here is how the game (or app) looked like:

And here is how I modified it:

![Bouncy - Juiced UP ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26c6c45c-f8f0-4b84-886c-c8bca991974d)


There are a bunch of effects that I've used which you can find in a list below:

 - Trail effect that follows the ball

 - Scale tweening for hitting the tiles
   
 - A ripple effect when hitting the tiles which gradually changes the color to the new one
 - A Particle effect when the ball collides with anything
 - Screen shake when the ball hits an opposing tile
 - The color of each tile gets interpolated when the ball passes over (It uses tween to change to and from the color
 - A water-like ripple when the ball hits the boundary
 - Ball flashing after colliding with something
 - A shining effect which swipes over the entire window when the ball hits a tile
